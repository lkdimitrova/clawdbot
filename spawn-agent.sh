## Before you start

Read \`.clawdbot_global_rules.md\` in the repo root (untracked, written by
spawn-agent.sh) for cross-repo agent conventions: TDD requirements,
conventional commits, PR body templates, the "Don't" list. These apply
on top of the repo's own \`AGENTS.md\` / \`CLAUDE.md\`.

\`.clawdbot_global_rules.md\` and \`.clawdbot_prompt.md\` are both listed
in \`.git/info/exclude\` — they'll never show up in \`git status\`, so
\`git add -A\` is safe.

## When you are completely finished with the coding task above:

1. Run all tests and make sure they pass.
2. Stage all changes: \`git add -A\` (runtime artifacts are excluded)
3. Commit with a conventional commit message. In the message body, add a
   \`Generated-by:\` trailer so the swarm agent that authored the work is
   attributable (the commit author itself is the maintainer, so Vercel /
   CI identity checks work). Example:

       git commit -m 'feat: <description>' -m 'Generated-by: $AGENT ($TASK_ID)'

4. Push the branch: \`git push origin HEAD\`
5. Create a PR against \`$_INTEGRATION\` (NEVER \`main\`, NEVER \`develop\`).
   A runtime \`gh\` wrapper enforces the base branch and auto-stamps an
   attribution footer in the PR body, so just run:

       gh pr create --base $_INTEGRATION --fill

   Do not add footer lines yourself; the wrapper handles it.
6. Then exit.

# ── Make global clawdbot rules available alongside the repo's AGENTS.md ──

# AGENTS.md in the worktree. That modified a *tracked* file, which coding
# agents then happily included in their commits via `git add -A` —
# polluting merged PRs with cross-repo tooling concerns (TDD rules,
# ~/antigravity-awesome-skills/ paths, etc.) that don't belong in the
# repo's source of truth. Caught by the swarm-review reviewer on PRs
# #158 and #159.
#
# Fix: write global rules to a SEPARATE file (.clawdbot_global_rules.md)
# that's gitignored via .git/info/exclude below, and point the agent at
# it in the prompt's completion instructions. Repo-local AGENTS.md stays
# untouched.

# exactly what we need: the two files spawn-agent.sh writes into the
# worktree (.clawdbot_prompt.md, .clawdbot_global_rules.md) are both
# new/untracked, so excluding them here makes `git add -A` skip them
# entirely.
#
# We do NOT exclude webapp/package-lock.json here — that file is
# tracked, and an agent legitimately updating deps would need the
# lockfile update to land. The swarm-review reviewer already flags
# incidental +N-thousand-line package-lock.json diffs as BLOCK when
# package.json isn't also changed, so the review gate covers that case.
# git's worktree model shares `.git/info/` across all worktrees and the
# main checkout (HEAD/index/logs are per-worktree, info/config/hooks
# are shared). So we append to the MAIN repo's exclude file — the
# pattern then applies in every linked worktree + the main checkout,
# which is exactly what we want (nobody should ever commit these
# clawdbot runtime artifacts).
